# lights.io

This little socket.io node simply returns the last colour set, to all its connected clients, in realtime - showcasing the power of the web (and node!).

### Install

Clone or download, put the public_html files in your public folder and update node.crowdlighting.com to your address in `admin/index.html`, `admin/assets/js/main.js`, `lights/index.html`.

Next up, run `npm install` in `/node`, when that finishes, simply run `node bin/server` and visit `youraddress.com/lights` or alternatively `lights.youraddress.com` to see the default `#f4f4f4` colour. You should now be able to change that colour up at `youraddress.com/admin`

### Why?
